                        <h3> Brunei's Abode of Peace </h3>
                        <p> In Brunei, its Islamic heritage takes centre stage and the state has built some iconic mosques around the country. Probably the most photographed religious landmark is the Omar ‘Ali Saifuddien mosque in Bandar Seri Begawan. 
                            This is usually a major highlight on inbound Islamic tours along with the famous mausoleum of the Sultan Bolkiah, the fifth Sultan of Brunei whose rule from 1485 made Brunei a powerhouse in the Malay archipelago, and the Islamic Calligraphy and Art Study Centre where priceless Islamic 
                            calligraphy art and artefacts are exhibited. </p>

                        <p> Luagan Lalak Recreation Park is home to an alluvial freshwater swamp known for its mesmerising beauty. The walkways extend out into the center of the swamp, as the mirror-like surface of the water reflects the open sky with all of its majesty. Each visit may be different too, as the water rises and falls with the seasons. In the dryer months, the water gives way to beautiful patches of sedges. It’s a great place for  walks and provides a beautiful scenery. </p>
